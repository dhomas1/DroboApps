# DroboApps
Final package of apps for Drobo NAS devices, as well as some versions of Drobo Dashboard for WIndows and Mac. Check the "Releases" page to download.

This is the final package of all DroboApps for 2nd generation Drobo NAS devices. These should work on Drobo 5N. 5N2, and 810n. There are newer versions of some of these apps delivered by the community, but these are the final versions of the apps as delivered by Drobo Inc. I am storing them here as they are no longer available from Drobo since their bankruptcy.
